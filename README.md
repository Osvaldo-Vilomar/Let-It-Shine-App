# Let-It-Shine-App

Here is the link to the entire project: https://github.com/udacity/Sunshine-Version-2

The link above demonstrates a sample of what we have learned to build over the course of six lessons.

This is the app that the Udacity course helps the student create. The material learned in the course is built on this app.
